"Where Is My Car" is a simple app that will operate as either a web app or a 
PhoneGap* app. It makes use of the Geolocation API and will let the user store a 
location and then later find the distance and direction back to that location. 
Try it as both a web app and a PhoneGap app across devices observe the difference 
in accuracy of devices with and without GPS.  This app also shows a unified 
system for getting startup events for both web apps and PhoneGap apps, as well 
as some other features like multiple pages in a single-page app, apple touch 
icon, and viewport meta.
